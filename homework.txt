Homework
Participants are required to build a DynamoDB table for application data storage and configure a CloudWatch alarm to monitor system health, based on provided specifications. They will have to incorporate these resources into the above existing AWS CloudFormation infrastructure.

Create a DynamoDB Table:
Objective: Design and implement a DynamoDB table named MyApplicationData intended for storing generic application data.

Specifications:
Primary Key: id (String)

Attributes: Participants should decide what additional attributes might be useful for application data.
Billing Mode: PAY_PER_REQUEST to accommodate varied access patterns.

Tags:
Key: 'Name' Value: 'MyDynamoDBTable'

Set Up a CloudWatch Alarm for High CPU Utilization:
Objective: Configure a CloudWatch alarm to monitor the CPU utilization of an AutoScaling group, ensuring it triggers under specified conditions.

Specifications:
Metric to Monitor: CPU Utilization of the EC2 instances within the AutoScaling group.
Threshold: Alarm when CPU utilization exceeds 75% for more than 5 consecutive minutes.
Notification: Configure an SNS topic (or another notification system) to alert when the alarm triggers.

Alarm Name: 'High CPU Utilization'
Additional Details: Provide the complete alarm configuration, specifying the namespace, statistic, period, and evaluation periods.

Outputs:
Define outputs in the CloudFormation template that provides the name of the DynamoDB table and an output for the CloudWatch Alarm ARN in your CloudFormation template.
